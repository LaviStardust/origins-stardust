# Stardust Origins

## What is this mod?

**Stardust Origins** is a mod for Origins that lets you play as various creatures, with their own proficiencies and struggles!

Our philosophy is to have complete origins with satisfying gameplays, while remaining balanced, approachable, and comfortable.

Are you a gentle fairy blessing the world with your presence?
A feisty rabbit expanding its den?
An animated doll guarding ruins long gone?
A feisty puppy fending for itself?

What are you, in that clockwork heart of yours?

## What do I get?

![This image shortly describes each origin available in the mod. Each of them have their sigil, name, an upside, and a downside. The Usawililikin is represented by a purple-pink sigil, made up of a spiral, three dashes, and a small V shape. This origin has stable flight, but is an easy prey. The Koijokin is represented by a grey-white sigil, made up of a flower and a circle. This origin is very tough, but made of clay. The Utalasewikin is represented by a brown-orange sigil, made up of two L shapes crossed, and a circle above a downwards bracket. This origin is highly mobile, but is limited in the armor it can wear. The Olinawenkin is represented by a blue-cyan sigil, made up of a heart, three dashes, and an upside-down V shape flattened from the middle. This origin is a great hunter, but is a picky eater.](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ZRGuXcsZ/images/497b389a1654b766e11e2fc5ae47af009ed23599.png)

There is so much more to come, too!

## What do I need?
**Stardust Origins** requires [Origins](https://modrinth.com/mod/origins) (or [Origins-Forge](https://modrinth.com/mod/origins-forge) if you use Forge), [Apugli](https://modrinth.com/mod/apugli), and [Pehkui](https://modrinth.com/mod/pehkui).

This mod works on Forge and Fabric alike.

This mod is required on server-side and client-side, because it uses custom resources.

<summary>Utalasewikin? Koijokin? What do these words mean?</summary>

The origin names are inspired by Toki Pona!

If you are familiar with it, you might notice the names might not make complete sense as constructed sentences, and that's intentional!
I want the names to express the vibes of each origin, but I also wanted to draw a sweet-looking sigil for each of them.
I was inspired by the Sitelen Pona pictograms!
They're really cute...

If this is new to you, look up a Toki Pona dictionary, and try to figure out what words each origin name is made of!
It can give you more of an idea on what each origin is truly meant to be.
